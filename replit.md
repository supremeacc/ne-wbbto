## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development, where features are developed and integrated in stages. Before making major changes or architectural decisions, please ask for my approval. I appreciate clear, concise explanations and prefer working with modular and well-documented code. Please do not make changes to the existing file structure without prior discussion.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Dynamic Embeds:** Utilizes Discord embeds with dynamic, color-coded designs based on AI-detected skill levels (Green, Yellow, Red) for introductions, and project types for team launches.
- **Emoji Integration:** Employs relevant emojis to enhance readability and visual cues.
- **Clean Layout:** Focuses on an organized presentation of information within Discord messages.

### Technical Implementations
- **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture, separating concerns for maintainability and scalability.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses JSON files (`profiles.json`, `projectData.json`, `vcSessions.json`, `userPreferences.json`, `botConfig.json`) for persistent data storage.
- **AI-Powered Processing:** Integrates Google Gemini AI for natural language understanding, text generation, and audio transcription.
- **Voice Capabilities:** Leverages `@discordjs/voice` for robust voice channel interaction, recording, and transcription.
- **PDF Generation:** Employs `pdfkit` for generating professional PDF meeting minutes.
- **Error Handling:** Includes comprehensive error handling for graceful fallbacks and user feedback.
- **Automated Actions:** Implements features like auto-deletion of intro messages and scheduled project cleanup.

### Feature Specifications
- **Member Introduction System:** Supports flexible intro formats, AI-powered semantic extraction, spelling/grammar correction, role/experience level assignment, and `updateintro`/`deleteintro` commands.
- **Team Launch System:** Manages project applications, approvals, and automated private workspace creation; includes `addTeammate`, `projectStatus`, and `projectShowcase` commands.
- **VC Summarizer & Meeting Assistant:** Records voice channel audio, transcribes using Gemini, provides multilingual summaries (English, Hindi, Hinglish) with dynamic color coding based on productivity, generates PDF meeting minutes, and offers `/stop-summary`, `/summarize-vc`, `/summary-mode`, and `/minutes` commands.
- **Teammate Matching:** AI analyzes profiles to suggest top 3 matches based on skills, interests, and goals via `/find_teammate`, providing compatibility scores.

### System Design Choices
- **Node.js with discord.js v14:** Chosen for asynchronous capabilities and Discord API wrapper.
- **Slash Commands:** Primary interaction method for users.
- **Environment Variables:** Configuration managed through Replit Secrets for security.
- **Discord Intents:** Explicitly configured for necessary bot permissions.
